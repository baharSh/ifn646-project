# IFN646 Project: COVID-19 X-ray Classification

This is a repository for IFN646: Biomedical Data Science Project under Semester 2, 2020 from Queensland University of Technology. The goal of this project is to build a classifier that will be able to classify the chest X-ray images into three categories: Normal, Pneumonia or COVID. Project contributors are:

* [Atif Ibne Zoha Sreezon][atif-github]
* Bahareh Shahrestanaki
* Nahid Ebrahimi

Current files in the repository includes:
* data_local_grab.ipynb: Grab aggregated images from the data folder and compress them into .h5 files.
* GPU_check.ipynbL Check if your Tensorflow installation is using your CUDA-supported GPU.
* PCA_LDA.ipynb: WIP. Will probably include classification using Principle Component Analysis and Linear Discrminant Analysis.
* test_tqdm.ipynb : A test notebook for TQDM progress bar library.
* envbiopy.yml: yml environment file that I used for my environment. You can use this file to build your own environment with specific libraries and dependencies.


## More is upcoming.
